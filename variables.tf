# Terraform loads variables in the following order,
# with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:
#     Locally exported Environment variables
#     The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
#     Any *.auto.tfvars processed in lexical order of their filenames.
#     Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided.
#     This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.
